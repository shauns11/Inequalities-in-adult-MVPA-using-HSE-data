**Abstract**

**Background**: Evidence is unclear on whether inequalities in average levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) reflect differences in participation, differences in the amount of time spent active, or both. Using
self-reported data from 24,882 adults (Health Survey for England 2008, 2012, 2016), we examined gender-specific
inequalities in these separate aspects for total and domain-specific MVPA.

**Methods**: Hurdle models accommodate continuous data with excess zeros and positive skewness. Such models
were used to assess differences between income groups in three aspects: (1) the probability of doing any MVPA,
(2) the average hours/week spent in MVPA, and (3) the average hours/week spent in MVPA conditional on participation
(MVPA-active). Inequalities were summarised on the absolute scale using average marginal effects (AMEs) after
confounder adjustment.

**Results**: Inequalities were robust to adjustment in each aspect for total MVPA and for sports/exercise. Differences
between adults in high-income versus low-income households in sports/exercise MVPA were 2.2 h/week among men
(95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6, 2.8) and 1.7 h/week among women (95% CI: 1.3, 2.1); differences in sports/exercise
MVPA-active were 1.3 h/week (95% CI: 0.4, 2.1) and 1.0 h/week (95% CI: 0.5, 1.6) for men and women, respectively.
Heterogeneity in associations was evident for the other domains. For example, adults in high-income versus lowincome households were more likely to do any walking (men: 13.0% (95% CI: 10.3, 15.8%); women: 10.2% (95% CI: 7.6,
12.8%)). Among all adults (including those who did no walking), the average hours/week spent walking showed no
difference by income. Among those who did any walking, adults in high-income versus low-income households
walked on average 1 h/week less (men: − 0.9 h/week (95% CI: − 1.7, − 0.2); women: − 1.0 h/week (95% CI: − 1.7, − 0.2))

**Conclusions**: Participation and the amount of time that adults spend in MVPA typically favours those in high-income
households. Monitoring inequalities in MVPA requires assessing different aspects of the distribution within each
domain. Reducing inequalities in sports/exercise requires policy actions and interventions to move adults in lowincome households from inactivity to activity, and to enable those already active to do more. Measures to promote
walking should focus efforts on reducing the sizeable income gap in the propensity to do any walking.
